# ECG ARRYTHMIA ANALYSER

I have created a comprehensive end-to-end ECG signal analysis pipeline, utilizing several high-performance libraries  like wfdb, biosppy, numpy, pandas, and tensorflow to enable data manipulation, visualization, and model training. Data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database is downloaded, and the ECG signal from record 100 is loaded using the wfdb library. The biosppy library processes the ECG, extracting R-peaks and heart rate, critical for detecting arrhythmias.
An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is constructed to classify ECG signal segments, leveraging deep learning through TensorFlow’s Keras API. ECG data is split into overlapping windows, transformed, and used to train the LSTM on sequence patterns indicative of arrhythmias. The model’s performance is validated and predictions are visualized. Finally, fpdf generates a PDF report summarizing test accuracy and loss, demonstrating advanced capabilities in medical signal processing, deep learning, and automated report generation.
